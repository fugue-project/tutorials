    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental distributed compute concepts is the partition. Our data is spread across several machines, and we often need to rearrange the way the data is spread across the machines. This is because of operations need all of the related data in one place. For example, calculating the median value per group requires all the data from the same group on one machine. Fugue allows users to control the paritioning scheme during execution.\n",
