    "So far we've used Fugue's `transform()` function to port Pandas code to Spark without any rewrites. The `transform()` function is very flexible so it can handle functions with varying input and output types.\n",

    "Decoupling logic and execution is one of the primary motivations of Fugue. This is meant to solve the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users have to learn an entirely new framework to work with distributed computing problems\n",
    "2. Logic written for a *small data* project is not reusable for a *big data* project\n",

    "4. Along with number 3, iterations for distributed computing problems become slower and more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue's core principle is to minimize code dependency on frameworks as much as possible, which provides flexibility and portability. **By decoupling logic and execution, we can focus on our logic in a scale-agnostic way and then choose which execution engine to use when the time arises.** In this section, we look at how to move from the `transform()` function to end-to-end workflows with `FugueWorkflow()`."

    "The `FugueWorkflow` is responsible for constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph, also called a DAG. A lot of people associate the DAG concept with workflow orchestration tools like Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster. While these tools also use DAGs, they use it in a different way than the distributed computing frameworks (Spark and Dask). For orchestration frameworks, the DAG is used to manage dependencies of scheduled tasks. For computing frameworks, the DAG represents a computation graph that is built, validated, and then executed. DAGs are used because distributed computing operations are very expensive and have a lot of room to be optimized. Also, mistakes in a distributed setting are very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue follows these distributed computing frameworks in using the DAG for validation before execution. DAGs can catch errors significantly earlier, in a way similar to compiling the computing job. For Fugue specifically, the built DAG validates schema, as well as provides the basis for further optimizations. For example, Fugue can detect which DataFrames are re-used in the computation graph and then persist them automatically to avoid recomputation. The DAG is a graph where the nodes are DataFrames connected by Fugue extensions. We already introduced the most common extension, which is the `transformer`. Schema is tracked throughout the DAG. More extensions will be introduced later."
