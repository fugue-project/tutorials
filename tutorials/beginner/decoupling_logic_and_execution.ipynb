    "# Decoupling Logic and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the motivations of Fugue is to decouple logic and execution. When transitioning a project from pandas to Spark, majority of the code to be re-written. This is because using pandas and Spark makes the code highly coupled with the framework. This leads to a couple of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users have to learn an entirely new framework to work with distributed compute problems\n",
    "2. Logic written for a *small data* project does not become reusable for a *big data* project\n",
    "3. Testing becomes a heavyweight process for distributed compute, especially Spark\n",
    "4. Along with number 3, iterations for distributed compute problems become slower and more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue believes that code should minimize dependency on frameworks as much as possible. This provides flexibility and portability. **By decoupling logic and execution, we can focus on our logic in a scale-agnostic way, and then choose which engine to use when the time arises.**"

    "Using distributed computing is currently harder than it needs to be. However, these systems often follow similar patterns, which have been abstracted to create a framework that lets users focus on defining their logic. We cover these concepts in the rest of tutorials. If you're new to distributed computing, Fugue is the perfect place to get started.\n",

Fugue, Modin, and Koalas have similar goals in making an easier distributed computing experience. The main difference is that Modin and Koalas use andas as the grammar for distributed compute. Fugue, on the other hand, uses native Python and SQL as the grammar for distributed compute (though pandas is also supported). \n",
