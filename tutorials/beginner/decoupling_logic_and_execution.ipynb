    "# Decoupling Logic and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section, we used Fugue's transform function to port pandas code to Spark. Decoupling logic and execution is one of the primary motivations of Fugue. When transitioning a project from pandas to Spark, the majority of the code normally has has to be re-written. This is because using either pandas or Spark makes code highly coupled with that framework. This leads to a couple of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users have to learn an entirely new framework to work with distributed compute problems\n",
    "2. Logic written for a *small data* project does not become reusable for a *big data* project\n",
    "3. Testing becomes a heavyweight process for distributed compute, especially Spark\n",
    "4. Along with number 3, iterations for distributed compute problems become slower and more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue believes that code should minimize dependency on frameworks as much as possible. This provides flexibility and portability. **By decoupling logic and execution, we can focus on our logic in a scale-agnostic way, and then choose which engine to use when the time arises.**"

    "The main concern of Fugue is clear readable code. **Users can write code in whatever expresses their logic the best**. The compute efficiency lost by using Fugue is unlikely to be significant, especially in comparison to the developer efficiency gained through more rapid iterations and easier maintenance. In fact, Fugue is designed in a way that often sees speed ups compared to inexperienced users working with native Spark code. Fugue handles a lot of the tricks necessary to use Spark effectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "Fugue code becomes easily testable because the function contains logic that is portable across all pandas, Spark, and Dask. All we have to do is run some values through the defined function. We can test code without the need to spin up compute resources (such as Spark or Dask clusters). This hardware often takes time to spin up just for a simple test, making it painful to run unit tests on Spark. Now, we can test quickly with native Python or pandas, and then execute on Spark when needed. Developers that use Fugue benefit from more rapid iterations in their data projects."

    "## Fugue as a Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue is a framework, but more importantly, it is a mindset. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fugue believes that the framework should adapt to the user, not the other way around\n",
    "2. Fugue lets users code express logic in a scale-agnostic way, with the tools they prefer\n",
    "3. Fugue values readability and maintainability of code over deep framework-specific optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Using distributed computing is currently harder than it needs to be. However, these systems often follow similar patterns, which have been abstracted to create a framework that lets users focus on defining their logic. We cover these concepts in the rest of tutorials. If you're new to distributed computing, Fugue is the perfect place to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Optional] Comparison to Modin and Koalas\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue gets compared a lot of Modin and Koalas. Modin is a pandas interface for execution on Dask, and Koalas is a pandas interface for execution on Spark. Fugue, Modin, and Koalas have similar goals in making an easier distributed computing experience. The main difference is that Modin and Koalas use pandas as the grammar for distributed compute. Fugue, on the other hand, uses native Python and SQL as the grammar for distributed compute (though pandas is also supported). \n",
    "\n",
    "The clearest example of pandas not being compatible with Spark is the acceptance of mixed-typed columns. A single column can have numeric and string values. Spark on the other hand, is strongly typed and enforces the schema. More than that, pandas is strongly reliant on the index for operations. As users transition to Spark, the index mindset does not hold as well. Order is not always guaranteed in a distributed system, there is an overhead to maintain a global index and moreover it is often not necessary."
