    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue is an abstraction layer for distributed computing frameworks such as Spark or Dask. The purpose of the abstraction layer is that users should not need to worry about the tool they are using when working with data. Often we'll find that logic written to solve problems is highly tied to a specific compute framework (Pandas, Spark or Dask). There are many problems that come out of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users have to learn an entirely new framework to work with distributed compute problems\n",
    "2. Logic written for a *small data* project does not become reusable for a *big data* project\n",
    "3. Testing becomes a heavyweight process for distrubted compute, especially Spark\n",
    "4. Along with number 3, iterations for distributed compute problems become slower and more expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoupling Logic and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the first two pain points above, we'll use a simple code example on a DataFrame with 2 string columns (*col1* and *col2*). This following operation will not make sense, but will show how Pandas and Spark syntactically differ.  We're will create a new column (*col3*). This third column with be a concatenation of the first column with the first 3 letters second column. This whole value will then be reversed. We will execute this logic on Pandas and Spark.\n"

Users can use the abstraction layer to only write one implementation of the function. This can then be applied to Pandas, Spark, and Dask.

Now, this fucntion is truly independent of any framework and written in native Python. **It is even independent from Fugue itself.** Fugue only appears when we reach the execution part of the code. Logic, however, is not coupled with any framework. Keen users may also notice that the type annotations in the `concat_and_reverse` caused the DataFrame to be converted before it was used by the function.

However, the philosophy of Fugue is clean and reusable logic that is portable across frameworks. We demonstrated that Fugue can be used on Pandas and Spark. To use it on Dask, we simply use the `DaskExecutionEngine`. The compute efficiency lost by using Fugue is unlikely to be significant, especially in comparison to the developer efficiency gained through more rapid iterations and easier maintenace.

Fugue, Modin, and Koalas have very similar goals in making an easier distributed computing experience. The main difference is that Modin and Koalas use Pandas as the grammar for distributed compute. Fugue, on the other hand, uses native Python and SQL as the grammar for distributed compute. \n",

Order is not always guaranteed in a distributed system, and there is an overhead to maintain a global index, even when it is not necessary."
