    "When data is small enough to fit on a laptop, it's simple for data practitioners to iterate on data projects. Most commonly, data practitioners use pandas and NumPy for their data analysis and feature engineering needs. These tools go well with scikit-learn to provide a stack capable of handling the end-to-end machine learning pipeline. This works great until data becomes too big to fit on a single machine. At this point, data practitioners need to move to distributed compute frameworks such as Spark and Dask to scale their solutions out."

    "pandas is great for small datasets, but unfortunately does not scale well large datasets. The primary reason is that pandas is single core, and does not take advantage of the available compute resources all of the time. A lot of operations also generate [intermediate copies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/scale.html#scaling-to-large-datasets) of data, causing more memory than necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to frameworks such as Spark and Dask. These frameworks allow us to split compute jobs across multiple machines. They also can handle datasets that don’t fit into memory by spilling data over to disk in some cases. Compared to Spark, Dask is the easier transition from pandas because it is built on top of the pandas DataFrames which means that there is strong parity between their APIs. But ultimately, moving to Spark or Dask still requires code changes from the user when coming from pandas.\n",

Using the abstraction layer allows users to take advantage of the Spark and Dask computation engines, while writing code in Python, pandas or SQL. This allows users to focus on the problems they are trying to solve, rather than learning a new framework for the job. This also provides concrete benefits that we’ll see throughout this tutorial.\n",

By using the `transform` function, we allowed the `predict` function to be applicable to both pandas and Spark. We’ll apply this same concept to entire workflows in the next section.\n",

This implementation uses the Spark’s `mapInPandas` method available in Spark 3.0. Note how the `schema` has to be handled inside the `run_predict` function. This is the `schema` requirement we mentioned earlier that Fugue provides a simpler interface for."
