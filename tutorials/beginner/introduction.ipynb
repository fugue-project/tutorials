    "When data is small enough to fit on a laptop, it's simple for data practitioners to iterate on data projects. Most commonly, data practitioners use pandas and NumPy for their data analysis and feature engineering needs. These tools go well with scikit-learn to provide a stack capable of handling the end-to-end machine learning pipeline. This works great until data becomes too big to fit on a single machine. At this point, data practitioners need to move to distributed compute frameworks such as Spark and Dask to scale their solutions out."

    "pandas is great for small datasets, but unfortunately does not scale well large datasets. The primary reason is that pandas is single core, and does not take advantage of all available compute resources. A lot of operations also generate [intermediate copies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/scale.html#scaling-to-large-datasets) of data, utilizing more memory than necessary. To effectively handle data with pandas, users preferably need to have [5x to 10x times](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/) as much RAM as the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark and Dask allow us to split compute jobs across multiple machines. They also can handle datasets that don’t fit into memory by spilling data over to disk in some cases. But ultimately, moving to Spark or Dask still requires code changes to port pandas code. Added to changing code, there is also a big shift in mindset needed to fully utilize the distributed compute engines. \n",

This implementation uses the Spark’s `mapInPandas` method available in Spark 3.0. Note how the `schema` has to be handled inside the `run_predict` function. This is the `schema` requirement we mentioned earlier that Fugue provides a simpler interface for."
