    "Nothing here is new. This should all be familiar last section, however we did not really dive into what the `FugueWorkflow` actually does. The `FugueWorkflow` is responsible for constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph, also called a DAG. A lot of people associate the DAG concept with workflow orchestration tools like Airflow, Prefect, of Dagster. While these tools also use DAGs, they use it in a different way than the distributed compute frameworks (Spark and Dask). For orchestration frameworks, the DAG is used to manage dependencies of scheduled tasks. For compute frameworks, the DAG represents a computation graph that is built, validated, and then executed. DAGs are used because distributed compute operations are very expensive and have a lot of room to be optimized. Also, mistakes in a distributed setting are very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue follows these distributed compute frameworks in using the DAG for validation before execution. DAGs can catch errors significantly earlier, similar to compiling the compute job. For Fugue specifically, the built DAG validates schema, as well as provides the basis for further optimizations. For example, Fugue can detect which DataFrames are re-used in the computation graph, and then persist them automatically to avoid recomputation. The DAG is a graph where the nodes are DataFrames connected by Fugue extensions. We already introduced the most common extension, which is the `transformer`. Schema is tracked throughout the DAG. More extensions will be introduced later."

    "This leads us to schema.  Schema is explicit in Fugue for a couple of reasons. First, is to allow quick validation if the computation job contains all the necessary columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this, explicit schema is very important in a distributed setting. The DataFrame can be split across multiple machines, and each machine only sees the data it holds. A strong schema guarantees that operations are performed as expected across all machines. A lot of heavy pandas users are not used to explicit schema but it becomes more important in a distributed setting. Inferring schema is an expensive operation. There are 3 basic ways to define schema with Fugue. Note that we are specifying the output schema of the extension."
