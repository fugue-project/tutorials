    "This is a deeper look at what the execution engine is. In practice, Fugue users will use the execution engines through the higher level Fugue API or FugueSQL. Only advanced use cases will require interacting with the execution engine directly, such as writing custom [extensions](../extensions/index.md). The code presented here is not meant to be used for working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution engine concept is the heart of Fugue. It is the layer that unifies the core concepts of distributed computing, and separates the underlying computing frameworks from user's high-level logic. The `ExecutionEngine` class of Fugue is a specification for all of the operations and behaviors that need to be supported in order to add a new backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Fugue, **the only dataset is schemaed dataframes**, so although there are other important concepts such as `RDD`, we don't cover them. Spark itself has moved to the DataFrame as the first-class API because confining the user operations to a limited set allows for deeper performance optimizations. Having more APIs and options can sometimes create confusion how to do certain operations efficiently. For more information about the difference of the DataFrame and RDD, check these articles. [1](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html) [2](https://data-flair.training/blogs/apache-spark-rdd-vs-dataframe-vs-dataset/)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Fugue does expose the most commonly used operations, it is important to note that **Fugue still provides access to the underlying computing frameworks.** For example, Spark users still have access to use `RDD`. This should be reserved for cases where it's really needed, as it creates a lock-in to Spark and reduces the benefit of using Fugue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no hard rules for initializing an ExecutionEngine. The general way is to initialize from configs. We should use the config to describe each components, such as what logger to use, what SQLEngine to use and other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the best practice to initialize each built-in ExecutionEngine. Again, it is rare for users to interact with these classes directly. These code snippets are for illustrative purposes.\n",
