    "# Outputter\n",
    "\n",
    "`Outputter` represents the logic unit executing on driver on the **entire** input dataframes WITHOUT output. It's called Outputter because normally this step is to output the data to certain location, or print on console.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input can be a single** `DataFrames`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatively, acceptable input DataFrame types**: `DataFrame`, `LocalDataFrame`, `pd.DataFrame`, `List[List[Any]]`, `Iterable[List[Any]]`, `EmptyAwareIterable[List[Any]]`, `List[Dict[str, Any]]`, `Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]`, `EmptyAwareIterable[Dict[str, Any]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output annotation must be None** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Before input DataFrames** you can have a parameter with `ExecutionEngine` annotation so Fugue will pass the current `ExecutionEngine` to you\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice\n",
    "* `ArrayDataFrame` and other local dataframes can't be used as annotation, you must use `LocalDataFrame` or `DataFrme`\n",
    "* Variations of `LocalDataFrame` will bring the entire dataset onto driver, for an Outputter this might be an expected operation, but you still need to be careful.\n",
    "* `Iterable` like input may have different exeuction plans to bring data to driver, in some cases it can be less optimial (slower), you must be careful.\n",
