    "The FugueWorkflow object creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where the nodes are DataFrames that are connected by extensions. Extensions are code that creates/modifies/outputs DataFrames. The `Transformer` we have been using is an example of an extension. In this section, we'll cover the other types of extensions: `Creator`, `Processor`, `Outputter`, and `CoTransformer`. For all extensions, schema has to be defined when used. Below are the types of extensions.\n",

    "We have actually already seen some built-in extensions that come with Fugue. For example, `load` is a `Creator` and `save` is an `Outputter`. There is a difference between `Driver side` and `Worker side` extensions. This will be covered at the end of this section. For now, we'll just see the syntax and use case for each extension.\n",

    "## Creator\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Creator` is an extension that takes no DataFrame as input but returns a DataFrame as output. It is used to generate DataFrames. Custom `Creators` can be used to load data from different sources (think AWS S3 or from a Database using pyodbc). Similar to the `Transformer` in the previous section, `Creators` can be defined with the schema hint comment or with the `@creator` decorator. `pd.DataFrame` is a special output type that does not require schema. For other output type hints, the schema is unknown so it needs to be defined.\n",
