    "# FugueSQL and Dask-sql\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas** and **Spark** already have solutions that allow users to execute SQL code to describe computation workflows. **Dask**, on the other hand, does not have a standard SQL interface yet. `FugueSQL` provides this feature with the DaskExecutionEngine, but users should also be aware that [dask-sql](https://dask-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a relatively new project and has a majority of SQL keywords implemented already. Additionally, it is also faster than FugueSql on average. However, there are still some features under development. Most notably, the SQL `WINDOW` is not yet implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are collaborating to have our solutions converge to create the de facto SQL interface for Dask. In the meantime, we have unified our solutions by allowing `FugueSQL` to use [dask-sql](https://dask-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as an [execution engine](../advanced/execution_engine.ipynb). The [dask_sql](https://github.com/nils-braun/dask-sql) project has added a `DaskSQLExecutionEngine` into their code to let us import it and pass it into `FugueSQLWorkflow`. Note this is a different engine from `Fugue's DaskExecutionEngine`\n",
    "\n",
    "`FugueSQLWorkflow` usage is nearly identical to the `fsql` function we saw previously. The main difference is that it takes in a SQL engine as seen in the example below."

    "This example below shows that when the SQL query cannot be executed in `dask-sql`, it will use the `FugueSQL`. We are able to use the `TAKE` and `PRINT` keywords even if they don't exist in `dask-sql`. We can also use the `TRANSFORM and PREPARTITION` even if these are `Fugue` keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "`FugueSQL` and `dask-sql` together can provide a more powerful solution. This allows us to use both solutions to get the best of both worlds in terms of speed and operation completeness. All we need to do is pass the `DaskSQLExecutionEngine` into `FugueSQLWorkflow`.\n",
