We have previously introduced extensions in the [FugueSQL section](../fugue_sql/extensions.ipynb). This section is a more comprehensive guide to extensions in Fugue. Extensions are user-created functions that perform operations on DataFrames. By converting these functions to the approriate extension, they can be brought into FugueSQL.

## Driver vs Worker

To fully understand extensions, it is important to understand the basic distributed compute architecture. A compute cluster is comprised of one `driver`, and multiple `worker` nodes. The `driver` is the machine responsible for orchestrating the `worker` machines. Because the driver is responsible for communciating and distributing work, it has access to information that worker nodes don't have. For example, it keeps track of partition information.

Because of this distinction in distributed computing, there will be code written that is specifically meant to be run on the `driver` machine. These are things like loading and saving a dataframe, or maybe the logic to divide the data into different partitions. On the other hand, code that runs on `workers` will be agnostic to what is happening on other workers.

Note that this means using a function to get the maximum value of a column behaves differently dependending if it is a client-side or worker-side extension. The client-side extension will give a global maximum, while the worker-side extension will give a local maximum.

## Extension Types

In the following descriptions, note the difference between `DataFrame` and `LocalDataFrame`. A `LocalDataFrame` is a dataframe that exists on a single machine. The `LocalDataFrame` is an abstraction for structures like `pd.DataFrame` or `List[List[Any]]`. On the other hand, the `DataFrame` is a dataframe that can exist on multiple machines. Fugue's `DataFrame` class is a abstract version of Spark or Dask DataFrames. `DataFrame` can only be used on driver.

**Driver-side extensions**

* [**Creator**](./creator.ipynb): no input, single output `DataFrame`, it is to produce a `DataFrame` to be used by other extensions
* [**Processor**](./processor.ipynb): one or multiple input `DataFrame`, single output `DataFrame`, it is to do certain transformation and pass to the next node
* [**Outputter**](./outputter.ipynb): one or multiple input `DataFrames`, no input, it is to finalize the process of the input, for example save or print

**Worker-side extensions**

* [**Transformer**](./transformer.ipynb): single `LocalDataFrame` in, single `LocalDataFrame` out
* [**CoTransformer**](./cotransformer.ipynb): one or multiple `LocalDataFrame` in, single `LocaDataFrame` out

**Advanced worker-side extensions**
* [**OutputTransformer**](./outputtransformer.ipynb): single `LocalDataFrame` in, no output
* [**OutputCoTransformer**](./outputcotransformer.ipynb): one or multiple `LocalDataFrame` in, no output

## [Interfaceless](./interfaceless.ipynb)

These extensions can be defined with the appropriate Python class or decorator. For example, a `transformer` can be defined with the `Transformer` class or by using the `@transformer` decorator with a Python function. These are **interfaces** provided by Fugue, but they are not required to convert functions to extensions. As seen in the beginner tutorial, schema hints can be used to define extensions. For example, the following function will create a new column called `c`. 

```python
# schema: *,c:int
def add_transformer(df:pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df['c'] = df['a'] + df['b']
    return df
```

This schema hint comment is read by Fugue to make the `add_transformer` an extension during runtime. In fact, the schema hint is not even required if the schema is provided during runtime as seen below. 

```python
from fugue import transform

def add_transformer(df:pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df['c'] = df['a'] + df['b']
    return df

df = transform(df, add_transformer, schema="*, c:int")
```

These approaches that leave the code in native Python are called the [interfaceless](./interfaceless.ipynb) approach and are the easiest way to use Fugue. They are designed to be non-invasive, and at the same time, encourage more maintainable code by working around typo annotations and comments. The resulting code is not tied to Fugue, and can run independently.

## Output Schema Requirement

There is a distinction when it comes to `driver`-side and `worker`-side extensions. The driver-side extensions (Creator, Processor, Outputter) have access to the schema, so there is no need to infer or guess it. This is why Fugue does not require the schema to be specified if the output annotation is one of `LocalDataFrame`, `DataFrame`, or `pd.DataFrame` for the `Creator`, `Processor`, and `Outputter`. 

For the `worker`-side extensions, things need to be a bit more explicit. Normally distributed computing frameworks can infer output schema, however, it is neither reliable nor efficient. To infer the schema, it has to go through at least one partition of data and figure out the possible schema. However, `transformers` can produce inconsistent schemas on different partitions. The inference can also take a long time or directly fail. So to avoid potential correctness and performance issues, `Transformer` and `CoTransformer` output schemas are required in Fugue.
