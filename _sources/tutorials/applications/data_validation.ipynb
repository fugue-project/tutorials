    "Data validation is having checks in place to make sure that data comes in the format and specifications that we expect. As data pipelines become more interconnected, the chance of changes unintentionally breaking other pipelines also increases. Validations are used to guarantee that upstream changes will not break the integrity of downstream data operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common data validation patterns include checking for NULL values or checking data frame shape to ensure transformations don’t drop any records. Other frequently used operations are checking for column existence and schema. Using data validation avoids silent failures of data processes where everything will run successfully but provide inaccurate results. \n",
