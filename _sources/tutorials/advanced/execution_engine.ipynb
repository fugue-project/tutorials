    "It is the heart of Fugue. It is the layer that unifies core concepts of distributed computing, and separates the underlying computing frameworks from user's high level logic. Normally you don't directly operate on execution engines. But it's good to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fugue, **the only dataset is schemaed dataframes**, so although there are other important concepts such as `RDD`, we don't cover them. More options may result in more flexibility or more confusion. You can read these [1](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html) [2](https://data-flair.training/blogs/apache-spark-rdd-vs-dataframe-vs-dataset/) to get more insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to understand that, **you have full access to any underlying computing frameworks**, and to use any specific features including `RDD`. We unify certain things to make them easy and consistent, but we don't block anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no hard rules for initializing an ExecutionEngine. The general way is to initialize from configs. We should use the config to describe each components, such as what logger to use, what SQLEngine to use and other properties.\n",
